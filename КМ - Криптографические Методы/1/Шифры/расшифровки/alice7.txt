Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The Looking-Glass, 
this was the one that she always remembered most clearly. 
Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again, 
as if it had been only yesterday—the mild blue eyes and kindly 
smile of the Knight—the setting sun gleaming through his hair,
 and shining on his armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled 
her—the horse quietly moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, 
cropping the grass at her feet—and the black shadows of the forest behind—all this 
she took in like a picture, as, with one hand shading her eyes, she leant against a tree, 
watching the strange pair, and listening, in a half dream, to the melancholy music of the song.
