when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised 
to find quite a large crowd collected round it 
there was a dispute going on between the executioner 
the king and the queen who were all talking at once 
while all the rest were quite silent and looked very 
uncomfortable 
the executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off 
a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that 
he had never had to do such a thing before and he 
wasnt going to begin at his time of life.
